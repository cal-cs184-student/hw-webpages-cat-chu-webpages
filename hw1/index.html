		<h2>Overview</h2>
		This assignment involves building a rasterizer, which processes graphics data stored in vectors and matrices
		into pixel images. Its tasks explore multiple ways to rasterize images and perform antialiasing, or reduce
		artifacts, such as supersampling and mipmap level sampling. Overall, this project taught me to visually
		experiment with and understand the outputs of varying sampling techniques at both a high-level (jaggies and
		Moire patterns remedied with antialiasing) and pixel-level via a pixel inspector toggle.

		<h2>Task 1: Drawing Single-Color Triangles</h2>
		To rasterize a triangle, I begin by defining Vector3D variables for each vertex, then ensure that the winding
		order is clockwise. Next, I determine the triangle's bounding box and iterated through its pixels - each
		pixel is filled with the triangle's color if it passes the point-in-triangle test, which determines if the point
		is within the three edges/lines of the triangle.
		<br><br>

		My algorithm is no worse than one that checks each sample within the bounding box of the triangle (the smallest
		rectangle encompassing the entire triangle) because it first defines the bounding box, then uses nested for
		loops to iterate through each sample within it once. In the innermost loop, the point-in-triangle test and pixel
		filling function run on a sample in constant time.

		<h2>Task 2: Antialiasing by Supersampling</h2>
		Supersampling is useful because it antialiases triangles by simulating the effect of a 1-pixel box (low
		pass) filter and attenuating high frequencies. Walking through my supersampling algorithm, it performs task 1's
		rasterization pipeline, but modifies it by adding nested for loops to iterate through
		<code>sqrt(sample_rate)</code> by <code>sqrt(sample_rate)</code> samples for each framebuffer pixel. It
		leverages and fills the sample buffer data structure of size <code>(width * height * sample rate)</code> first,
		then resolves to the actual framebuffer data structure <code>(width *height)</code> by designating each color
		value to the average of the respective samples. The result of this supersampling process is antialiased
		triangles, as seen in the following images: jaggies along a skinny triangle corner are removed/blurred as the
		sample rate increases and more subsamples are averaged to compute the final color.

		<h2>Task 3: Transforms</h2>
		After implementing translate, scale and rotate functions, I rendered the following drawing of cubeman. By
		translating and rotating cubeman's right lower arm, I was trying to get cubeman to wave.

		<h2>Task 4: Barycentric coordinates</h2>
		Barycentric coordinates \( (α, β, γ) \) define a coordinate system for triangles that, for instance, simplifies
		the linear interpolation of colors. Taking a look at the following triangle on the left, we can create
		a color gradient by expressing each point \( (x,y) \) in the triangle in terms of its vertices:
		<br><br>

		\( (x, y) = αA + βB + γC \) <br>
		\( α + β + γ = 1 \)
		<br><br>

		where A, B and C are the RGB colors at its vertices.

		<h2>Task 5: "Pixel sampling" for texture mapping</h2>
		Pixel sampling involves assigning pixel colors by mapping from a texture image onto the screen image. To
		implement it, for each rasterized screen sample \( (x,y) \), I find the corresponding texture coordinates \(
		(u,v) \). Then, I sample the texel in texture space and assign its color to \( (x,y) \).
		<br><br>

		The nearest pixel sampling method rounds the continuous \( (u,v) \) vector to the nearest integer coordinates
		and returns the corresponding texel's color, while the bilinear pixel sampling method interpolates the color at
		that continuous point from its four neighboring texels (two horizontal lerps and one vertical lerp).

		<br><br>
		In the following images, bilinear sampling clearly defeats nearest sampling:
		<br><br>

		<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center;">
			<table style="width: 100%; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;">
				<tr>
					<td style="text-align: center;">
						<img src="media/task5_nearest1.png" width="400px" />
						<figcaption>Nearest Sampling at 1 Sample Per Pixel</figcaption>
					</td>
					<td style="text-align: center;">
						<img src="media/task5_nearest16.png" width="400px" />
						<figcaption>Nearest Sampling at 16 Samples Per Pixel</figcaption>
					</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td style="text-align: center;">
						<img src="media/task5_bilinear1.png" width="400px" />
						<figcaption>Bilinear Sampling at 1 Sample Per Pixel</figcaption>
					</td>
					<td style="text-align: center;">
						<img src="media/task5_bilinear16.png" width="400px" />
						<figcaption>Bilinear Sampling at 16 Samples Per Pixel</figcaption>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
		</div>

		<br>
		Nearest sampling returns a more pixelated image than bilinear sampling, which returns a more blended image. When
		sampling rate increases from 1 to 16, the jaggies are a bit smoother: we see the letter 'K' more connected and
		'E' sharper and more clearly defined. Similarly, bilinear sampling at 16 samples per pixel returns a smoother
		result than nearest sampling at the same sample rate. The difference is most noticeable at edges or areas with
		high-frequency details since nearest sampling selects the color of a single neighboring texel, while bilinear
		sampling blends multiple texels to produce a more gradual transition.

		<h2>Task 6: "Level Sampling" with mipmaps for texture mapping</h2>
		Level sampling determines the appropriate mipmap level for texture mapping based on how much a region in texture
		space is being minified when mapped onto the screen. I implement it by first calculating the directional
		texture coordinate gradients \( (du/dx,dv/dx) \) and \( (du/dy,dv/dy) \). Taking the maximum of their
		magnitudes L, I compute the mipmap level to use, \( D = \log_2 L \) (texture image downsampled D times).
		Finally, depending on
		<code>sp.lsm == {L_ZERO, L_NEAREST, L_LINEAR}</code> and
		<code>sp.psm == {P_NEAREST, P_LINEAR}</code>, I apply nearest or bilinear sampling at the 0th mipmap level,
		rounded/nearest mipmap level or interpolate the sampling result at neighboring mipmap levels
		<code>floor(D)</code> and <code>ceil(D)</code>.
		<br><br>

		The sampling technique of the number of samples per pixel (supersampling) slows down speed and takes up
		significantly more memory to compute/store the intermediate sample buffer data structure, but has the best
		antialiasing power.
		Pixel sampling is much faster and uses minimal memory, as it only processes texels from mipmap level
		0, but has poor antialiasing power.
		Level sampling improves upon pixel sampling. While it involves slightly slower computation to calculate
		gradients, it still has relatively low storage overhead with Williams' proposed mipmap layout and, importantly,
		much better antialiasing power - at higher mipmap levels, it is able to leverage low pass filtered,
		downsampled texture images to perform antialiasing.
		<br><br>

		In the following images <code>L_ZERO</code> isn't able to reduce the aliasing/splotches happening at
		thinner and closer stripes (high frequencies), but <code>L_NEAREST</code> is able to leverage an appropriate
		mipmap level and reduce antialiasing:
